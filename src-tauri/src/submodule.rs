//! Submodule status (M1) + init/update (M2) + add/sync (M3) + deinit/remove
//! (M4).
//!
//! Read-only, git2-based (mirrors `git_write::list_refs`'s read half): iterates
//! every submodule registered in `.gitmodules` via `Repository::submodules()`
//! and classifies each with `Repository::submodule_status(name, SubmoduleIgnore::None)`.
//!
//! Classification (empirically verified against real `git submodule status` in
//! a throwaway nested-submodule fixture — see the doc comment on
//! `classify_status` for the exact bit patterns observed for each of the 6
//! bit/index-derived states, and how they line up with git's own `-`/`+`/`
//! `/`U` prefixes; there is a 7th, `submodule_status`-specific state,
//! "unreadable", layered on top of all of them — see its own bullet below):
//!   - "unreadable": CRASH FIX — `submodule_status_inner` unconditionally
//!     called `repo.submodule_status(name, ..)` for every top-level
//!     submodule, with no cycle check at all. That call itself is what
//!     stack-overflows (crashing the ENTIRE application process) when asked
//!     about a submodule whose own resolved git directory, or ANYTHING
//!     reachable in its nested-submodule subtree at any depth, is cyclic
//!     (a malformed or maliciously crafted `.git` gitfile pointer) — and,
//!     more surprisingly, the identical crash fires for any ANCESTOR of the
//!     cyclic node too, not just the offending submodule itself. `submodule_status`
//!     runs AUTOMATICALLY every time a repo is opened (the sidebar's own
//!     `refreshSubmodules()`), so an unguarded call here crashed the whole app
//!     just from OPENING a third-party/untrusted repo containing such a
//!     submodule — no opt-in action needed. Fixed by
//!     `check_submodule_safe_for_status`, which verifies (via the
//!     canonicalize-and-track-visited-paths mechanism `check_safe_to_recurse`/
//!     `discover_nested_targets` implement, below in this file) that a
//!     top-level submodule's ENTIRE reachable subtree is confirmed
//!     cycle-free BEFORE `submodule_status_inner` ever calls
//!     `repo.submodule_status()` on it. When it is not, "unreadable" is
//!     reported directly and `submodule_status` is never called for that row
//!     at all — this takes priority over every classification below (none of
//!     them can be safely computed once this is true; see
//!     `submodule_status_inner`). The frontend never offers Init/Update/Sync/
//!     Deinit/Remove for this status — see `submoduleAction`/Sidebar.svelte.
//!   - "conflicted": the superproject's OWN index has an unresolved merge
//!     conflict at this submodule's gitlink path (two branches pointed the
//!     submodule at different commits, now conflicted). This is NOT one of
//!     `SubmoduleStatus`'s bits — verified empirically that none of them
//!     reliably fire for this case — so it's detected separately via
//!     `Index::conflicts()` (see `submodule_conflicted`) and takes priority
//!     over every bit-derived classification below (a conflicted gitlink entry
//!     can otherwise leave head_sha/workdir_sha looking plausible while the
//!     repo is genuinely mid-conflict).
//!   - "removed": INDEX_DELETED set — `submodule_remove` has already STAGED
//!     this submodule's removal (its gitlink deleted from the index) but
//!     nothing is committed yet, so it still shows up here (HEAD's own
//!     committed `.gitmodules` is unchanged). Added as a bug fix (see M4's own
//!     doc comment below): none of the WD_* bits below fire for this case
//!     either, so without this check it fell all the way through to "clean" —
//!     a ghost row for a submodule that's already gone in every way that
//!     matters. Checked BEFORE every WD_* arm below (same reasoning as
//!     "conflicted" above).
//!   - "not-initialized": WD_UNINITIALIZED or WD_DELETED set (git's `-`
//!     prefix). WD_UNINITIALIZED is produced by a fresh `git clone` of the
//!     superproject with no `git submodule init/update` run afterward — NOT by
//!     `git submodule add`, which leaves the submodule immediately initialized
//!     *and* cloned. WD_DELETED is the sibling case: the submodule was
//!     manually `rm -rf`'d (not `git submodule deinit`'d) — "in index, not in
//!     workdir". Real `git submodule status` shows the same `-` prefix for
//!     both, so we fold them together too.
//!   - "out-of-date": WD_MODIFIED set (git's `+` prefix) — the commit actually
//!     checked out in the submodule's working tree differs from the commit the
//!     superproject's index/HEAD records for it (`Submodule::head_id()` !=
//!     `Submodule::workdir_id()`).
//!   - "dirty": WD_INDEX_MODIFIED, WD_WD_MODIFIED, or WD_UNTRACKED set — the
//!     submodule's own working tree (or its own index, for a staged-but-
//!     uncommitted change) differs from what it has committed. This is
//!     libgit2's own canonical "is dirty" bitset (see git2/submodule.h).
//!     NOTE: plain `git submodule status` does NOT surface this in its prefix
//!     (it stays a plain space); it only shows up via `git status --porcelain`
//!     (" M <path>") or `git diff --submodule` in the superproject. Verified
//!     empirically that git2 catches what the porcelain status line catches.
//!   - "clean": present, initialized, and none of the above — checked-out
//!     commit matches what's tracked, no local changes.
//! Priority when bits combine (e.g. WD_MODIFIED + WD_WD_MODIFIED, checked out
//! at the "wrong" commit AND locally modified) — verified this combination
//! empirically too: `git submodule status` still only ever reports `+`, never
//! a distinct "dirty AND out of date" state, so we mirror that and check
//! conflicted, then not-initialized, then out-of-date, then dirty, in that
//! order. "unreadable" (see its own bullet above) is checked before ANY of
//! this — before `submodule_status`/`submodule_conflicted` are even called —
//! since none of these bit-derived classifications can be safely computed at
//! all once a submodule's own reachable subtree is confirmed cyclic.
//!
//! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//! M2: `submodule_init` / `submodule_update` — mutations, CLI-shellout model.
//! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//!
//! Same shell-out-to-git-CLI-for-mutations model as `git_write.rs`/
//! `git_remote.rs` (git2 stays read-only everywhere in this codebase). Reuses
//! `git_write::WriteResult` verbatim as the return type (rather than adding a
//! fourth structurally-identical `{ok, message, backup_ref}` copy) but keeps
//! its own private `run_git`/validation helpers — matching `git_tag.rs`'s
//! precedent for "reuse the shared RESULT SHAPE, not a shared helper surface"
//! (see `git_remote.rs`'s own doc comment for why this codebase prefers one
//! self-contained runner per module over a shared cross-module helper).
//!
//! SAFETY MANAGER — neither command takes a snapshot, for two different reasons:
//!   * [`submodule_init`] only copies a URL (and, if set, a branch) from the
//!     superproject's committed `.gitmodules` into its OWN `.git/config`. It
//!     never touches a ref, the index, HEAD, or any working tree — there is
//!     nothing reachable-or-history-affecting for a snapshot to protect
//!     (identical reasoning to `git_tag.rs`'s `create_tag`: purely additive
//!     local bookkeeping, nothing for Undo to guard).
//!   * [`submodule_update`] moves HEAD and checks out files, but ONLY inside
//!     the *submodule's own separate `.git`* — never the superproject's HEAD,
//!     branches, or working tree (the gitlink entry the superproject itself
//!     tracks for that path is completely unchanged by this command; only
//!     what happens to be checked out AT that already-recorded commit
//!     changes). This is exactly `git_remote.rs`'s own "nothing local
//!     changes" reasoning for why plain `push` takes no snapshot — just one
//!     level down, inside the submodule's nested repo instead of a remote.
//!     The one real safety consideration — losing UNCOMMITTED work inside a
//!     dirty submodule's working tree — is handled a different way, below,
//!     not by a superproject snapshot (which couldn't protect it anyway: the
//!     Safety Manager only ever pins the SUPERPROJECT's refs, and a
//!     submodule's uncommitted-but-unstaged edits were never reachable from
//!     any ref in the first place, superproject or submodule).
//!
//! DIRTY-SUBMODULE SAFETY: never passes `--force`. Real git's OWN default
//! already refuses to check out over local modifications inside a submodule
//! ("error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten
//! by checkout ... Aborting" / "fatal: Unable to checkout '<sha>' in
//! submodule path '<path>'") — exactly this codebase's existing "never
//! force, surface git's own rejection" convention (`checkout`/`pull`). This
//! was EMPIRICALLY VERIFIED in a throwaway fixture before trusting it (and is
//! re-verified in `tests/submodule.rs`): a submodule whose tracked commit was
//! bumped out from under it (simulating a pulled superproject commit that
//! advanced the pointer) while its own working tree carried an uncommitted
//! edit to the very file that differs between the two commits — `git
//! submodule update` refused cleanly (non-zero exit, the message above), left
//! the uncommitted edit's content completely intact, and left the
//! submodule's own checked-out HEAD unmoved. No `--force` flag exists on
//! either command below to override that refusal.
//!
//! `submodule_init` and `submodule_update` are deliberately separate calls
//! (matching real `git submodule init` / `git submodule update` being
//! separate subcommands) so the UI can offer both a plain "Update" (assumes
//! already-registered/cloned; `init:false`) and a combined "Init + Update"
//! convenience for a never-initialized row (`init:true`, which folds
//! `submodule_init`'s registration step into the same `git submodule update
//! --init` invocation rather than requiring two round-trips).
//!
//! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//! M3: `submodule_add` / `submodule_sync` — new submodule + URL re-sync.
//! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//!
//! `--end-of-options` DOES NOT WORK HERE — EMPIRICALLY VERIFIED (git 2.53)
//! before writing either command below, since every other mutation in this
//! codebase leans on it: `git submodule add --end-of-options -- <url> <path>`
//! (and `git submodule sync --end-of-options -- <path>`) both fail outright
//! with git's own top-level USAGE error, never reaching the actual add/sync
//! logic. Unlike the plumbing commands this codebase's other modules shell
//! out to (`branch`, `tag`, `checkout`, ...), which all understand the
//! generic `--end-of-options` the top-level `git` driver provides,
//! `git-submodule` is its own porcelain argument parser (a wrapper script /
//! `submodule--helper` dispatch) that only recognizes a bare `--` to end
//! option parsing. So both commands below place a plain `--` immediately
//! before their positional args instead, exactly like real `git submodule
//! add`/`sync --help`'s own usage grammar shows, and rely on
//! `validate_repository_url`/`validate_branch_name`/`validate_submodule_path`
//! rejecting anything that starts with `-` before it ever reaches the CLI —
//! same defense-in-depth split this codebase already uses everywhere else,
//! just with `--` standing in for `--end-of-options` for this one git
//! subcommand family.
//!
//! PATH COLLISION (`submodule_add`'s `submodule_path` already exists, or is
//! already a registered submodule): NO Rust-side pre-check — EMPIRICALLY
//! VERIFIED (git 2.53, throwaway fixture, every colliding case tried) that
//! real `git submodule add` already refuses cleanly and unambiguously on its
//! own:
//!   - a tracked file OR tracked directory already at that path: "fatal:
//!     '<path>' already exists in the index"
//!   - an untracked directory in the way, whether empty or with untracked
//!     content: "fatal: '<path>' already exists and is not a valid git repo"
//!   - a path that's already a registered submodule (its gitlink already in
//!     the index from a prior `add`): also "fatal: '<path>' already exists in
//!     the index" (same message as the first case — plausible, since a
//!     registered submodule's gitlink IS an index entry)
//! All three are already specific about WHY the path is unusable, so a
//! redundant Rust-side existence/registration check would only duplicate
//! git's own clean refusal, not add real signal over it — surfaced verbatim
//! below, matching this codebase's existing "never force, surface git's own
//! rejection" convention (`checkout`/`pull`/`submodule_update`'s own dirty-
//! submodule refusal above).
//!
//! No snapshot on either command:
//!   * [`submodule_add`] clones a new submodule, adds one new `.gitmodules`
//!     entry, and stages both — purely additive (a new gitlink + a new
//!     tracked file, both freshly staged, nothing committed yet). Nothing
//!     reachable becomes unreachable and no ref moves — identical reasoning
//!     to `create_branch`/`create_tag`'s own no-snapshot rationale for
//!     additive-only operations.
//!   * [`submodule_sync`] only rewrites entries under `submodule.*` in the
//!     superproject's OWN `.git/config` from what's currently committed in
//!     `.gitmodules` — no ref moves, no index/workdir change, nothing
//!     history-affecting for Undo to protect (needed after someone hand-edits
//!     `.gitmodules`'s `url` field directly, e.g. by hand or via a merge —
//!     that edit alone never updates `.git/config`; `git submodule sync` is
//!     the dedicated command that copies it over, verified empirically in
//!     `tests/submodule.rs` by reading `.git/config` directly before/after).

/// `submodule_status` runs AUTOMATICALLY on every repo-open (the sidebar's

///
/// Reuses, rather than re-derives, `discover_nested_targets`/

///   - Otherwise, `sm`'s own directory is confirmed unique so far, but (per
///     the "ancestor crashes too" surprise above) that alone does not make

// M4: deinit / remove
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// EMPIRICALLY VERIFIED (git 2.53.0, throwaway fixtures, re-verified by hand
// before writing this code — not trusted from a design doc alone):
//   * `git submodule deinit [-f] -- <path>` clears the submodule's OWN
//     working tree down to an empty directory and `git config --unset`s its
//     `[submodule "<path>"]` section from the SUPERPROJECT's `.git/config` —
//     but never touches `.gitmodules`, never touches the superproject's own
//     index/HEAD/gitlink entry, and (this is the safety property the UI is
//     built around) NEVER touches `.git/modules/<name>` — the submodule's own
//     object database (its refs/objects/history). A subsequent
//     `submodule_init` + `submodule_update` (even with the original remote
//     permanently gone — verified by `mv`ing the source repo away first)
//     restores the exact checked-out content with ZERO network/fetch
//     activity, straight from `.git/modules/<name>`.
//   * Without `-f`, deinit refuses cleanly (exit 128) on ANY of: an
//     uncommitted tracked edit, an untracked file, OR a merge-conflicted
//     gitlink entry in the SUPERPROJECT's own index (verified: the
//     submodule's own tree can be perfectly clean and it still refuses) —
//     always the same message: "error: the following file has local
//     modifications: ... fatal: ... use '-f' to discard them". With `-f`, all
//     of that content is silently gone — "Cleared directory '<path>'" is the
//     entire trace, confirming the backup-before-force need is real, not
//     hypothetical. A conflicted-gitlink `deinit -f` does NOT resolve the
//     conflict itself (that lives in the superproject's index, untouched by
//     deinit).
//   * `git rm -f -- <path>` (after a `deinit -f`) removes the gitlink AND
//     strips+stages the matching `[submodule ...]` section of `.gitmodules`
//     in one step (real, current git's documented `git-rm` behavior — see
//     `man git-rm`), leaving exactly `M  .gitmodules` / `D  <path>` staged,
//     nothing committed, no stray directory. `--cached` is deliberately NOT
//     used: verified it leaves an empty stray directory forever AND does not
//     auto-strip `.gitmodules`. Path -> registered name resolution is done by
//     `git rm` internally (verified with a submodule added via `--name` !=
//     path), so this module keeps passing paths, never names, matching
//     init/update/sync/add.
//   * `git rm -f` on a conflicted gitlink resolves that path's 3-way conflict
//     as a side effect (collapses to one clean `D` entry) — a genuine (not
//     just tolerated) benefit of `submodule_remove` on a conflicted row.
//
// SAFETY MANAGER: no ref snapshot on either command (same reasoning as every
// other command in this file — see its doc comments above). `submodule_deinit`
// only ever touches the submodule's OWN working tree and the superproject's
// OWN `.git/config` — never a ref. `submodule_remove` additionally only ever
// STAGES an index change (a gitlink deletion + a `.gitmodules` edit) —
// staging is not a ref move either, identical reasoning to `stage_file`/
// `stage_all`'s own no-snapshot rationale (workdir.rs). The one genuinely
// destructible thing here — a submodule's own UNCOMMITTED content — is

// Rust — `force:false` just tries the plain command and surfaces whatever
// git says verbatim (dirty OR conflicted-gitlink refusal, either way an
// honest git message). `force:true`'s only extra job is deciding whether a
// backup write is needed first, which is answered by a DIRECT walk of the
// submodule's own tree (its own staged index, its own unstaged working-tree
// edits, its own untracked files) — a strictly narrower, more literal
// question than replicating git's own refusal logic, and one that gives the
// right answer regardless of *why* git would otherwise have refused (see
// `backup_submodule_dirty_content`).
//
// `submodule_remove` takes no `force` parameter — it always behaves as force
// internally (the whole point of "remove" is unconditional; the frontend's
// own confirm dialog is the gate, not a second forced round-trip) and never
// auto-commits — only ever stages, mirroring `submodule_add`'s own "clone +

///
/// SECOND EMPIRICAL SURPRISE, ALSO CONFIRMED WITH A MINIMAL REPRO: it is not
/// enough to guard the call for the cyclic node ITSELF — asking libgit2 for
/// the status of ONE OF ITS ANCESTORS crashes too, even though the ancestor's

/// `parent` -> submodule `sub` -> submodule `nested`, with only `nested`'s
/// gitfile redirected back at `sub`'s own git directory, `parent
/// .submodule_status("sub", ..)` ALONE — never mind ever asking about

/// status computation transitively walks its reachable workdir, including
/// `nested`, however deep). So `discover_nested_targets` cannot just skip
/// calling status for the cyclic node while trusting its ancestors' OWN
/// already-computed status to be safe — every ancestor up to and including
/// the offending node must be identified as unsafe-to-status-check BEFORE any
/// of them are queried, which is why this function now does a
/// post-order walk: it recurses into a submodule's own children FIRST
/// (`sm.open()` + `check_safe_to_recurse`/depth-check only — always safe, no
/// status calls) and only calls `nested_submodule_status` for a node ONCE
/// its entire reachable subtree, at any depth, is confirmed cycle-free. This
/// is also why `submodule_status_inner` never special-cases the TOP-LEVEL
/// list (see `check_submodule_safe_for_status`'s own doc comment): that call
/// is exactly as unsafe as any deeper one for the exact same reason.
///
/// Fixed by canonicalizing (`std::fs::canonicalize`) each submodule's own
/// resolved GIT DIRECTORY (`Repository::path()`, exactly what
/// `Submodule::open()` hands back — this, not the working directory, is what
/// determines what `repo.submodules()`/`repo.submodule_status()` will chase
/// NEXT, so it's the correct cycle key: a workdir-only alias with a

/// visited in a `HashSet` threaded through the whole recursive walk
/// (`visited`, seeded by the caller — `submodule_status_inner` — with the
/// outermost superproject's own canonical git directory). See
/// `check_safe_to_recurse` for the actual check/insert. `MAX_SUBMODULE_RECURSION_DEPTH`
/// above is an additional, independent depth cap applied alongside this one
/// — defense-in-depth, not a substitute for it.
///
/// Either check failing (a real cycle, an unresolvable path, or the depth
/// cap) records a `ForeachTarget` with a `skip_reason` for the OFFENDING path
